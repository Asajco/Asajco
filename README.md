- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jakub


-I'm a passionate junior Web developer, mostly focusing on UI design, but I can also build a full web page according to your ideas.

-I'm currently studying at the University of Matej Bell in Slovakia / applied informatics and software engineering.

-I have been an exchange student in Finland at the University of Applied Science, where I studied Web development which I stuck to.

In the future I really would like to extend my knowleage to different frameworks like NextJS and also be really confident in styled-components,
and also try to create some back-end apps.
