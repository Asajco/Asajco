- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jakub


-I'm a passionate junior Front-end developer, last year I gain a lot of experience working as a Front-end developer at BeCode, where i learned TypeScript and gained a lot of experiences in React.

-I graduated at the University of Matej Bell in Slovakia / applied informatics and software engineering.

-I have been an exchange student in Finland at the University of Applied Science, where I studied Web development which I stuck to.

In the future, I would like to extend my knowledge to different frameworks like NextJS and learn more about Backend development.
